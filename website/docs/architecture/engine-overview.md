# CFDL Engine Architecture

The **CFDL Engine** is a high-performance financial computation engine implemented in Julia that processes CFDL models and generates detailed cash flow analyses with Monte Carlo simulation capabilities.

## 🏗️ **Engine Status: 100% Complete**

All 6 core components have been implemented and validated with comprehensive testing:

- ✅ **Monte Carlo Harness**: Trial orchestration framework
- ✅ **Temporal Grid Generator**: Time period structure foundation  
- ✅ **Stream Allocator**: Cash flow allocation with logic blocks
- ✅ **Cash-Flow Aggregator**: Multi-view hierarchical aggregation
- ✅ **Metrics Library**: Financial calculations (NPV, IRR, DSCR, MOIC, Payback)
- ✅ **Waterfall Distributor**: Tiered distribution logic

### 7-Stage Cash Flow Pipeline

Each trial executes through a sophisticated 7-stage pipeline:

1. **Temporal Grid Generation**: Creates time period structure
2. **Stream Allocation**: Distributes cash flows across time periods
3. **Cash Flow Assembly**: Aggregates streams into coherent cash flows
4. **Operating Statement**: Generates financial statements
5. **Financing Adjustments**: Applies debt service and financing costs
6. **Tax Processing**: Calculates tax implications
7. **Available Cash Calculation**: Determines distributable cash flow
