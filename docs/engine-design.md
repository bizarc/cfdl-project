# CFDL Engine Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for the CFDL Engine, which processes Intermediate Representation (IR) files generated by the Java compilation pipeline to produce cash flow analyses, financial metrics, and distribution waterfalls.

## Architecture Principles

### Monte Carlo as Orchestrator
The engine is designed with Monte Carlo simulation as the primary orchestrating framework, supporting both:
- **Deterministic execution**: Single trial with fixed parameters
- **Stochastic execution**: Multiple trials with parameter variation

### Hierarchical Processing
Data flows through the system at multiple hierarchy levels:
```
Deal → Asset → Component → Stream → Cash Flow Entries
```

### Extensible Design
Architecture supports future enhancements:
- State modeling and transitions
- Event-driven processing
- Real options (dynamic model modification)
- Advanced stochastic processes

## Implementation Language: Julia

**Rationale**: Based on research showing 300x+ performance improvements in financial applications, Julia provides:
- Native mathematical computing performance
- Rich ecosystem for optimization and time-series analysis
- Parallel computing capabilities for Monte Carlo
- Standalone binary deployment capabilities

## Component Architecture

### 2.1 Monte Carlo Harness ✅ COMPLETED
**Purpose**: Orchestrate trial execution and manage stochastic variables

**Implementation Status**: Complete with 31 passing tests

**Key Features Implemented**:
- ✅ **Monte Carlo Orchestration**: Supports both deterministic (1 trial) and stochastic (N trials) execution
- ✅ **Stochastic Parameter Sampling**: Handles Normal, Uniform, LogNormal distributions and Random Walk processes
- ✅ **Seed Management**: Reproducible results with unique seeds per trial
- ✅ **IR JSON Loading**: Flexible parsing of compilation pipeline output
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Full unit test coverage with robust error handling

**Stochastic Variable Types**:
- **Fixed**: `rent_growth = 3%`
- **Distribution Sampling**: `rent_growth ~ Normal(3%, 1%)` (sample once per trial)
- **Random Walk**: `rent_growth[t] = rent_growth[t-1] + Normal(0%, 0.5%)` (evolves over time)

**Performance**: 100 trials in ~0.027 seconds with memory-efficient implementation

**Input**: IR JSON + stochastic parameter definitions
**Output**: Trial controller that executes downstream pipeline

### 2.2 Temporal Grid Generator ✅ COMPLETED

- "If oil price < $50 → switch extraction strategy" (component behavior change)
- "If interest rates > 6% → refinance" (deal structure change)

**Performance**: Allocates 120 stream entries (2 streams × 60 periods) in ~0.001 seconds

**Demo Integration**: 
- Shows $22M+ total allocations across 5-year period
- Revenue: $16.3M, Expenses: $5.7M with proper growth application

        # Deterministic execution
        result = execute_trial(1, ir_data, nothing)
        return [result]
    else
        # Stochastic execution with parallel trials
        return parallel_map(1:num_trials) do trial_id
