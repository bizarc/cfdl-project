# CFDL Engine Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for the CFDL Engine, which processes Intermediate Representation (IR) files generated by the Java compilation pipeline to produce cash flow analyses, financial metrics, and distribution waterfalls.

## Architecture Principles

### Monte Carlo as Orchestrator
The engine is designed with Monte Carlo simulation as the primary orchestrating framework, supporting both:
- **Deterministic execution**: Single trial with fixed parameters
- **Stochastic execution**: Multiple trials with parameter variation

### Hierarchical Processing
Data flows through the system at multiple hierarchy levels:
```
Deal â†’ Asset â†’ Component â†’ Stream â†’ Cash Flow Entries
```

### Extensible Design
Architecture supports future enhancements:
- State modeling and transitions
- Event-driven processing
- Real options (dynamic model modification)
- Advanced stochastic processes

## Implementation Language: Julia

**Rationale**: Based on research showing 300x+ performance improvements in financial applications, Julia provides:
- Native mathematical computing performance
- Rich ecosystem for optimization and time-series analysis
- Parallel computing capabilities for Monte Carlo
- Standalone binary deployment capabilities
