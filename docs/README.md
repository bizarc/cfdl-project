# CFDL Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the CFDL (Cash Flow Definition Language) project.

## Documents

### [execution_plan.canvas.md](./execution_plan.canvas.md)
The main project roadmap outlining all phases from DSL compilation through UI development.

### [engine-design.md](./engine-design.md)
Detailed technical design document for the CFDL Engine (Task 2), including:
- Architecture principles and component design
- Monte Carlo orchestration framework
- Stochastic variable handling
- Real options and extensibility planning
- Implementation specifications

## Project Overview

CFDL is a domain-specific language for financial cash flow modeling, designed for:
- Commercial real estate analysis
- Multi-asset portfolio modeling  
- Complex waterfall distributions
